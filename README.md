E-Commerce Database Platform Project
Summary:

Hello! I am an inspiring data analyst and in this project is an intermediate SQL database created for an e-commerce platform. I have created the tables also with sample data to perform data analysis on this database. In this series of projects that I will be posting, each one will get more advanced per posting. I am looking to gain more advanced skills in this area of data science. Please leave any comments, I would love any advice to improve my skills. 


This sample e-commerce platoform provides a good starting point for testing your e-commerce platform. You can add more data or modify existing entries as needed for your specific use case. 

Keep in mind that in a real-world scenario, you would properly hash passwords before storing them, you might want to generate more realistic and diverse data. 

- 10 data analysis concepts you can apply to a database such as this e-commerce database:
1. Sales Analysis by Product Category
2. Customer Lifetime Value(CLV)
3. Product Performance Analysis 
4. Customer Segmentation by Purchase Frequency
5. Seasonal Sales Trends
6. Cart Abandonment Analysis 
7. Product Affinity Analysis(Which products are often bought together)
8. Customer Review Sentiment Analysis
9. Inventory Turnover Rate
10. Customer Acquisition Cost(assuming we have a Marketing table)

These queries demonstrate various data analysis concepts applied to the e-commerce database, including sales analysis, customer segmentation, product performance, seasonal trends, cart abandonment, product affinity, sentiment analysis, inventory management, and customer acquisition cost.
